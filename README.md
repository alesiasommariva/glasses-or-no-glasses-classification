# Glasses or no glasses classification
The goal of this project is to create a convolutional neural network that classifies images of people wearing glasses or not, both prescription and sunglasses. This goal is achieved by doing several experiments with different architectures. A more detailed explanation of experiments can be found in the report ```report_MSA_AFMD.pdf```.

## Organization
In ```project_AFMD_SM2L.ipynb``` can be found the whole project code including preprocessing, experiments and tests.
In ```report_MSA_AFMD``` directory can be found images and report.
