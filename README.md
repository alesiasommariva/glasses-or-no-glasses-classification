# Glasses or no glasses classification
The goal of this project is to create a convolutional neural network to classify images of people wearing / not wearing glasses, both prescription and sunglasses. This goal is achieved by doing several experiments with different architectures. A more detailed explanation of the experiments can be found in the report “““report_MSA_AFMD.pdf“““.

## Organization
In ```project_AFMD_SM2L.ipynb``` can be found the whole project code including preprocessing, experiments and tests.
In the directory ```report_MSA_AFMD``` can be found the images used in the report and the report written in latex.
